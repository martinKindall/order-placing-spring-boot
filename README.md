# Order Placing System

The goal of this project is to get started with Spring Boot and Domain Driven Design using a functional approach.

The software is very simple in fact, but it requires a lot of domain validation for securing the business logic. 
It uses MongoDB to persist data, and reactive streams to manage the flow of information. This project is based on the book 
_Domain Modeling Made Functional_ by Scott Wlaschin.
